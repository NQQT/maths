// Unit tests for the WORD PROBLEMS worksheet plugin.
//
// The plugin's generator is DETERMINISTIC: the entire sheet is pinned to exact
// expected values from the same seed the framework uses
// (seedFrom([grade.id, spec.id, 0])), plus the exact page-2 continuation row.
// Word problems are TWO-PART connected stories (a)/(b); Prep does not offer
// them. Beyond the pins this suite re-derives EVERY part answer from the
// printed prompt across a 10-page document (answer-correctness regression),
// and pins the depth (100% two-part), density (4 per page) and range
// (everything within the grade's wordCap) contracts.
