// ROWS & COLUMNS WORKSHEET — a self-contained Year-1/2 counting worksheet that
// builds the FOUNDATION OF MULTIPLICATION: students read a drawn grid, report
// its rows, columns and total, then bridge from repeated addition (Year 1) to
// simple products r × c (Year 2).
//
// QUALITY-OVER-QUANTITY (T2V): six roomy single-column items per page, and
// the page now opens with the FULL observation task ('look': report rows,
// columns AND total from the printed grid — every answer subpart is checked
// against the same figure) before the relational and bridge forms drill the
// pieces. EVERY item prints its grid (the shared RowsColumnsDiagram draws the
// exact r × c lattice large enough to tick squares off with a pencil), so no
// question ever asks about a grid the student cannot see.
//
// Like every plugin it lives in ONE file (see plugins/index.ts): the generator
// calculates all prompts/answers, framework/RowsColumnsDiagram.tsx only draws
// the supplied r × c square lattice in preview AND print, and answers stay
// private problem data exactly as the clock's and shape answers do.
//
// Fully self-contained: deleting this file and its line in plugins/index.ts
// removes the Rows & Columns worksheet without affecting the framework or any
// other plugin.
