// FRAMEWORK — unique sampling primitives (ported verbatim from the English
// distribution, framework/sampling.ts — keep the two files in sync).
//
// The worksheet generators used to sample with plain `rng.pick(pool)` inside a
// `for` loop, so questions repeated freely the moment a document grew past its
// pool (a 24-question addition sheet built from `rng.int` draws repeats pairs
// within two pages). These two utilities are the shared fix, and every sampling
// generator builds on them:
//
//   - `createDeck(rng, pool)`  — deal WITHOUT replacement. Every element is
//     dealt exactly once per "cycle"; when the deck runs dry it reshuffles and
//     continues, with a guard so the first card of a fresh cycle can never be
//     the last card just dealt. Decks spread pool coverage evenly across a
//     long document instead of clustering on lucky picks.
//
//   - `sampleUnique(count, produce, keyOf)` — collect `count` items whose
//     `keyOf` fingerprints (the printed prompt) are all DISTINCT. Duplicates
//     are discarded and redrawn until the target is met, so a generator can
//     emit a thousand questions without a single repeat as long as its
//     question space is big enough. When the space IS smaller than the ask,
//     the fallback tail fills with (evenly spread) repeats rather than
//     failing — a sheet is always complete.
//
// Both are deterministic: same seeded Rng stream => same output.
